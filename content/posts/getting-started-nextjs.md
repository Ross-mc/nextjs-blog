# Next JS

NextJS provides many benefits over standard React.

It provides built in solutions to problems that have been countered with React. For example, your pages folder will automatically generate routing instead of relying on a third party package such as React-Router. It also means you can use server side rendering to provide a better user experience.

## Key Features

- Folder based page structure for routing
- Server side rendering of static pages
- SEO optimisation due to server side rendering
- Serverless functions with api routing in pages folder
- Dynamic page routing with `[id].js` syntax.
